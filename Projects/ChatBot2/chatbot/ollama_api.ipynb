      " The color of the sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. As sunlight reaches Earth's atmosphere, it interacts with molecules and particles in the air, such as nitrogen and oxygen. Blue light has a shorter wavelength and gets scattered more easily than other colors because of its smaller size. As a result, when we look up at the sky, we predominantly see the scattered blue light. However, during sunrise and sunset, the sky can take on various hues of red, orange, and pink due to the scattering of sunlight in the Earth's atmosphere at those specific angles.\n"

      " The color of the sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. When sunlight reaches Earth's atmosphere, it interacts with molecules and particles in the air, such as nitrogen and oxygen. These gas molecules scatter shorter wavelengths of light, which include blue and violet light, more than other colors. As a result, the sky appears blue during the daytime. However, you might wonder why we don't see a violet-colored sky instead of blue. This is because our eyes are more sensitive to blue light and human eyes perceive blue light more easily than violet light. Additionally, some of the violet light gets absorbed or scattered in other directions by the ozone layer in the stratosphere, preventing it from reaching our line of sight as consistently as blue light."
